There are two types of value in JS
* OBJECT
* PRIMITIVE

@ If a value is not an object then it is a primitve in JS

Primitve Data Types (7 types)
* Number : Floating point numbers -> used for decimals and integers
* String : Sequence of characters -> used for text
* Boolean : Logical type that can only be true or false -> used for taking decisions
* undefined : Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined ('empty value')
* Null : Also means 'empty value'
* Symbol (ES2015): Value that is unique and cannot be changed

@ Javascript has dynamic typing (Weakly typed) :
we don't have to manually define the data type of the value stored in a variable. instead, data types are determined automatically

@ In JS values have type, but the variables don't. Variables are only used to store data.
